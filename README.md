#  Shell v2üöÄ

_holberton project on shell_

## Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple UNIX command interpreter with slightly advanced functionality and applying the concepts of a robust shell. In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to execute. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.

* How does a shell work?
* What is a PID and a ppid, and how to use them.
* How to manipulate the current process environment.
* What is the difference between a function and a system call?
* How to create processes.
* How does the shell use the `` PATH`` to find the programs?
* How to run another program with the system call `` execve```.
* How to suspend the execution of a process until one of its children ends.

### Compilation
